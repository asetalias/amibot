Tired of slow and unreliable access to your Amity University student portal? Introducing Amibot, the chat bot that allows you to easily access all your important information on WhatsApp. With Amibot, you can quickly view your grades, attendance, class schedule, and more without ever having to log in to the Amizone website.

## Using Amibot

Either deploy your own instance, or use the official Amibot instance by clicking the badge on the top.

## Features

- **Interactive and easy-to-use interface:** Amibot provides a simple and intuitive interface on WhatsApp, allowing you to access your information with just a few taps.
- **Access to attendance and class schedule:** Amibot already provides information on your attendance and classes.
- **Faculty feedback:** Amibot targets a big pain point in the average Amity student's life: Faculty feedback. It can automate the process for you, filling feedback for all your faculties at once.
- **Works even when network connectivity is limited:** Amibot works even when you have limited connectivity, allowing you to access your information anywhere, even on Campus :smile:!
  Since Amibot uses WhatsApp, you can see previously queried information even when you are offline.
- **Platform independent:** Got an iPhone? No problem. Use Amibot on anything that runs WhatsApp.

## What Makes Amibot Different?

- **No need to install an additional app:** Unlike other solutions, Amibot does not require you to install a separate app on your device. You can simply use the WhatsApp app that you already have installed.
- **Lightweight and efficient:** Amibot uses a textual format for data, requiring less bandwidth and making it more efficient than other solutions. It will even work on 2G networks!
- **Open-source:** Review the code, contribute to the project or even host your own instance.

## Future Plans

- **Add more features and integrations:** We're constantly working on adding new features and integrations to improve the user experience.
- **Allow students to schedule daily delivery of class schedules and attendance information:** In the future, Amibot _might_ allow you to schedule daily delivery of your class schedule and attendance information via a WhatsApp message.
