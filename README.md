**AMIBOT** is a simple but robust bot that can access the contents from Amity Student Portal - *Amizone* and display them right in WhatsApp itself.

---
## What were the various issues which were being faced by the students ?

Amizone is _the_ student portal for [Amity University](https://www.amity.edu/). It's indispensable for the students as they can
access their grades, attendance, class schedule and other information. But there is a catch: it's buggy, slow and goes down all the
time! Students have made a slew of alternative apps and tools to access the portal over the years -- including mobile
apps, but only for Android which too weren't up to the mark.

## What was the solution ?

We were presented with the same problem and thought of making a proper app for both Android and iOS. But then, after many discussions, we arrived at a proper solution and that was to make a WhatsApp Bot because hey, WhatsApp is used by almost everyone on daily purpose, so why not make a bot that is integrated with its API and serves the purpose without having any need to install another app!
