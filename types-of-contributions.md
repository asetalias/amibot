## What are the ways in which I can contribute to this project?

This might be the question in your head when you were using Amibot or going through the code.

Well, its very simple.

#### If you are a complete beginner, you can just open up the readme file or any such documentation file and look for any typing or grammatical errors in them. 

If present, just fork this repository, create a new branch and edit the file to rectify those specific errors. Once that is done, commit the changes to the file and simply create a pull request to get it merged if it is a valid error.

If you find any bugs while using the Amibot or have any suggestions to improve or add any new features to the bot, please do so by opening an issue in this repository.

_Remember, creating issues is a great way to contribute to the project! 😊_


#### And if you are an intermediate in Javascript, then?

Well then you can go through the open issues/code, and fix issues or refactor the code for improved quality, readability or conciseness.


#### More advanced JS user? 

Write codes that can be added to the Amibot to increase its functionalities. The features that can be implemented in future are given at the end of the readme.md file, so do check them out.
